## About the Author

This repository is the work of George Perdrizet, who spent way too long in graduate school earning a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology before realizing that pipetting for hours on end wasn't quite scratching the intellectual itch. After a brief teaching chemistry and making the questionable life choice of pivoting to machine learning via bootcamp, he now spends his days as an Instructor at Fullstack Academy and a Senior Data Science Mentor at 4Geeks Academy, teaching the next generation of ML practitioners and data scientists to avoid his mistakes.

When not mentoring students, he's busy being the Founder of Ask Agatha, a startup that somehow convinced Google to give them $25,000 in cloud credits to detect LLM-generated text (the irony is not lost on him). His journey from studying riboswitch folding mechanisms to teaching students why their random forest isn't actually that random has been... educational.
